# SpringBoot Application
# Getting Started 

### Steps to build and launch the application
1. Go to project dir (i.e. bay1) and run `mvn clean install`
2. Once  build is success run `java -jar target/bay1-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar <LOCAL_PATH>/bay1/input.txt` to run the app.
   I've added the input file in the project dir but it could be anywhere on local machine.
